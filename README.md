# Arduino-Dark-Theme
Dark Arduino Theme  Still works for Arduino version 1.8.5 and above.

# Note For all User Platforms:

You may need to install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino site, not a place like the Microsoft Store.

# INSTALLATION 

# MAC users:

Mac users should look in /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib and replace the theme folder inside (Just to be safe make a copy of the original in case want to revert back).

# Windows users:

Windows is located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib and replace the theme folder inside (Just to be safe make a copy of the original in case want to revert back). 

# Linux users:

Linux will be in /usr/share/arduino/lib/ and replace the theme folder inside (Just to be safe make a copy of the original in case want to revert back). 

# Customization 

The newest version of the Arduino IDE makes creating custom themes trickier: you now need to edit the theme.txt file, an XML file inside the syntax folder, and the button files. Unfortunately, not all items in the theme.txt file actually work, so if you can't get an item to change, try another one of the files. 

Make sure to make a back-up of the existing "theme" folder before replacing it for human error confrontations.
